<tw-passagedata pid="14" name="streets" tags="" position="453,1006">On the street, the cardboard houses are visibly sagging as the moisture from the mist makes them damp. 

You try to peer in a window, but realise that the windows are simply frames drawn onto the cardboard, like a child&#39;s drawing. No people are visible on the street.

You debate whether to [[knock on doors]], or return to the [[village]].</tw-passagedata>

&quot;It&#39;s me&quot; you answer. For the moment, your name has escaped you. This is less frightening than it would be normally. 

The door opens, partially. It&#39;s just a flap in the cardboard, with a doorknob drawn on it, but it opens wide enough to admit you inside.

Inside, you find yourself in a normal-looking room that you know well. You used to come here often to visit Anna. This was the kitchen in Anna&#39;s first flat, the one with the bathroom off the kitchen and the overgrown sunken garden, and carpet that doesn&#39;t reach to the walls. Anna hasn&#39;t lived here for years.

From this side, the door looks like a normal door. You look outside again, and see the rocky mountain side and cardboard houses are still there. 

Anna is sitting at the kitchen table, drinking spiced tea and smoking a rolled-up cigarette, just like she always did. 

But for some reason, she also has the head of a mouse. This is odd, because Anna definitely always did have a human head.

Anna laughs.

&quot;You know, all that, &#39;Last night I dreamt I was a butterfly, and then when I woke up, I wondered if I was a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or something, something, something…&#39;&quot;

You laugh, too, thinking that you&#39;ve missed this conversation. Not others that you had, though. But you realise that you remember this specific conversation.

<tw-passagedata pid="43" name="What happened to your head?" tags="" position="212,1785">Anna doesn&#39;t reply, but finishes her cigarette. She starts straight away to roll another one, dropping bits of tobacco as she does. She has her regular hands, quick and clumsy as ever.

You remember how much it used to annoy you when she dropped tobacco everywhere, how you were always picking it out the carpet. You feel a little petty when you think about how big a deal you used to make it out if it.

&quot;Plunge it alive into boiling water?&quot; you suggest. You don&#39;t think before you say it. You just remember how this conversation went.

&quot;So if you write a program that plunges your lobster program into programmed boiling water… Is that cruel? It’s just a dream of a lobster. But does it know that?&quot; Mouse-Anna looks thoughtful.

<tw-passagedata pid="48" name="Did I ever tell you I had this dream about us?" tags="" position="868,1279">&quot;I don‘t think I want to hear this&quot; says Anna.

You remember the dream. After you and Anna broke up, you dreamt that we went for a walk, and you had a conversation.

You asked Anna if it was really over, and she said that it was, but that she was sorry. And then - then you had a moment when I realized you was dreaming, and you said to Anna “This is a dream, isn’t it?”

Mouse-Anna in front of you asks, &quot;What did I say to that?&quot;

You say to Anna: &quot;You told me that, yes it was a dream, but that I was still really talking to you, and you really talking to me. We just happened to be doing it in a dream&quot;.

&quot;[[It was a strange dream|]]
&quot;[[So? Did that conversation really happen? Or was it just something that I dreamt?]]&quot;
