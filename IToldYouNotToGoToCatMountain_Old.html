You wake up cold and damp. (if: $fallen is false)[The surface underneath you is hard and uncomfortable, and your right arm is numb from being trapped under your body.Where are you? The last thing you remember you were getting into bed at home.]

You sit up, and realise that you are outside, now sitting up on rocky ground. You try to massage some life back into your cramped arm. The damp is from the air, as a thick mist lies across all you can see.

Through the mist, you can make out the jagged shape of a [[mountain]] rising up ahead of you. (if: $fallen is true)[It is at the same time both strange, and also as if you have been here before.](if: $toy is true)[You are clutching the feather stick cat toy in your hand so tightly that your nails have left dents in your palm.]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="2" name="mountain" tags="" position="432,249">The mountain rises above you. The fog makes it hard to be sure but it look like a sharp and jagged tooth. A [[path]] leads up the mountain, rocky and steep. You can barely see in front of you. A few paces, at the most. The path disappears into the [[mist]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="path" tags="" position="454,504">It&#39;s a path leading up the mountain, lined by a few [[trees]]. The fog seems a little thinner as it rises up, although your visibility is still measured in paces.

You take a moment to [[smell the air]].

The path is thin and rocky, but you think you should be able to [[climb up the path]] - even though, as you gloomily realise, you are in your bare feet. You try not to panic as you think how you got from your bed to your current location in your pyjamas and bare feet.

It&#39;s either that or hang around here at the bottom of the [[mountain]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="mist" tags="" position="327,377">The mist is cold. You can feel the damp soaking into your clothes. Looking down, you see that you are wearing only your pyjamas. You don&#39;t know how you ended up here in just your sleepwear.

You can&#39;t see anybody else around, either on the [[path]] or in the direction leading [[away from the mountain]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="5" name="away from the mountain" tags="" position="199,376">You turn your back on the incisor-shaped mountain. You trudge away from it across bare flat ground. 

The visibility was bad before. It seems even worse now. 

If you hold your arm out in front of you, you can barely see the end of your fingers as you head [[further from the mountain]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="6" name="further from the mountain" tags="" position="306,249">As you walk away from the mountain, you hear [[strange sounds in the mist]].

You are making a determind effort to walk in a straight line, but you can&#39;t shake the feeling that you are not walking in the direction you intend. You could swear the landscape is [[rearranging beneath your feet]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="7" name="climb up the path" tags="" position="453,630">As you climb up the path, the air is definitely clearing. In fact, you can see shapes ahead on you. Are those houses? 

You start to hurry. Thank goodness, there are houses there will be people there, you&#39;ll explain the them what happened, maybe they will be able to tell you where you are, they can call someone...

You draw closer to the first building. It looks odd - it&#39;s square shaped, with brown sagging walls. Is that a painted on window...? You start to feel confused as you [[enter the village]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="8" name="trees" tags="" position="326,504">A few stunted trees grow in the rocky mountain soil at the side of the [[path]]. Looking closely, the trees seem to have been... scraped? Scratched? There are long raking marks down them, and some have bent and broken where they look like they have been chewed in the middle. What would chew a tree like that?</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="9" name="smell the air" tags="" position="606,503">The air on the [[path]] is still wet with moisture, but you catch a smell of something else as well. Bitter and sharp, it&#39;s familiar but you can&#39;t quite place it. It seems to get stronger and more distinct the higher you get.

 </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="10" name="strange sounds in the mist" tags="" position="177,250">Through the mist, you can hear intermittent noises. It sounds faint, and faraway, but it remind you of.. squealing? No - it&#39;s like mewling, like a small animal. The piteous cries seem to call you [[further from the mountain]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="11" name="enter the village" tags="" position="453,755">You look closely at the first house that you come to. It is made out of cardboard. 

In fact, it is a cardboard box. 

A cardboad box, with windows drawn on and flaps cut in for doors.

This is the strangest [[village]] you have ever seen.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="12" name="village" tags="" position="453,880">You walk further into the village to look for someone to talk to. The streets are quiet. You notice that all the houses are cardboard boxes. 

You find yourself at a crossroads. You hope one of the paths will lead you to someone to talk to.

The path ahead of you looks like it leads to stalls set out in a [[market]].

The path to your left leads into a smaller warren of [[streets]].

The path to your right looks like it leads to a rocky cliff marking the [[edge of the village|edge of the village]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="13" name="market" tags="" position="325,876">In a square of cardboard-box houses is a ring of [[market stalls]]. A single stallholder stands behind one of the the stalls. Finally - a person!. 

There is also a path that leads on up [[through the village]], further up the mountain.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="14" name="streets" tags="" position="453,1005">On the street, the cardboard houses are visibly sagging as the moisture from the mist makes them damp. 

You try to peer in a window, but realise that the windows are simply frames drawn onto the cardboard, like a child&amp;#39;s drawing. No people are visible on the street.

You debate whether to [[knock on doors]], or return to the [[village]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="15" name="one house" tags="" position="24,1276">&quot;Who is it?&quot; calls a voice that you recognise.

&quot;It&#39;s me&quot; you answer. For the moment, your name has escaped you. This is less frightening than it would be normally. 

The door opens, partially. It&#39;s just a flap in the cardboard, with a doorknob drawn on it, but it opens wide enough to admit you inside.

Inside, you find yourself in a normal-looking room that you know well. You used to come here often to visit Anna. This was the kitchen in Anna&#39;s first flat, the one with the bathroom off the kitchen and the overgrown sunken garden, and carpet that doesn&#39;t reach to the walls. Anna hasn&#39;t lived here for years.

From this side, the door looks like a normal door. You look outside again, and see the rocky mountain side and cardboard houses are still there. 

Anna is sitting at the kitchen table, drinking spiced tea and smoking a rolled-up cigarette, just like she always did. 

But for some reason, she also has the head of a mouse. This is odd, because Anna definitely always did have a human head.

&quot;[[Anna!]]&quot;</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="16" name="edge of the village" tags="" position="580,1000">(if: $molly is true)[You head a thump sound behind you. Molly is watching you, crouched to pounce.
]
Ahead of you, you see the [[edge of the cliff]]. 

The mist hangs still in the air, and the egde of the cliff seems like the edge of the world. You can see nothing beyond or below, just the blanketing haze ahead or the [[village]] behind. 

It&#39;s hard to imagine that any other world even exists.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="17" name="market stalls" tags="" position="198,877">There are a few different stalls in the market, although you are the only customer. 

There is just one that has a stallholder though, and he appears to be a giant frog. You feel mild surprise, but it doesn&#39;t seem that unusual, here.

On his stall are [[piles of old junk]].

&quot;[[I don&#39;t know where I am...|stallholder]]&quot;
&quot;[[Can you help me?|stallholder]]&quot;

</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="18" name="through the village" tags="" position="325,1132">Heading through the village leads to a path leading [[further up the mountain]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="19" name="piles of old junk" tags="" position="66,841">The market stall has heaps of old fish skeletons, picked clean of their flesh. 

There are strange leaf-like objects that you recognise eventually as the wings of moths.

There is a single immaculate Brillo pad.

There are eviscerated slugs.

There is a bobble felt mouse with chewing marks on it.

It is the sort of trash that Molly, your cat, would obsessively hoard in her spot under the sofa bed at home. The stallholder who is also a frog looks at you, and blinks his see-through eyelids. There is nothing you want to buy on this or any other [[market stalls]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="20" name="edge of the cliff" tags="" position="830,879">Here you can [[look over the edge]].

(if: $molly is true)[You wave that cat toy [[over the edge]].]
(else:)[Head back to the [[village]].]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="21" name="look over the edge" tags="" position="956,878">In front of you and below you, there is the white fog, and nothing else. The bitter-pine smell is strong. The air is still. 

From within the fog, you think you can hear the odd faint sound - is it a sqeak? A cry? It&#39;s hard to tell, and you could be imagining it in this barren, melancholy landscape.

[[Head back to the edge of the cliff|edge of the cliff]]
[[Step over the egde, towards the sounds|falling]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="22" name="further up the mountain" tags="" position="325,1257">A steep rocky path leads up the mountain. Do you [[follow it up]] or, head back down to the [[village|through the village]] ?</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="23" name="rearranging beneath your feet" tags="" position="303,121">You trudge on. The mist begins to clear a little, thankfully, and you hurry forwards towards...

The [[mountain]] where you were just a moment ago? But how can that be? You must have somehow got turned around in that fog - but you were SURE you were heading away from the mountain...</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="24" name="stallholder" tags="" position="197,752">The stallholder looks at you, his eyes a black pupil rimmed with gold. He blinks, once, a strange operation whereby his eyes dip down behind a milky-clear eyelid.

&quot;I told you&quot;  he says, slowly.

&quot;[[Told me what?]]&quot;</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="25" name="follow it up" tags="" position="324,1382">As you climb up the mountain the air gets thinner. Breath becomes shallower. The mist clears and you see that you are winding up around the side of the mountain. Steep cliffs fall away to your left, and sheer rock rise up to your right. You spiral [[upwards]].

</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="26" name="upwards" tags="" position="449,1381">At last the path levels out. You are at the top of the mountain. Looking down, you cannot see anything below you but the clouds. Along the path is a [[cave]].

There is a sharp, bitter [[scent]].
</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="27" name="cave" tags="" position="449,1506">
The cave is very dark, and smells of meat. A low rumbling comes from [[inside the cave]].

</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="28" name="scent" tags="" position="580,1503">Outside the [[cave|upwards]]  rocks have been scrabbled over to hide animal scat with a sharp, bitter scent.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="29" name="inside the cave" tags="" position="449,1631">Inside the cave sleeps a giant white cat with black tips to her ears. She is enormous - the size of an office building, of a hillside. She is tight and snug within the cave.

The cat seems [[familiar]].

She sees you, and wiggles. The whole mountain when she [[wiggles|wiggles]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="30" name="familiar" tags="" position="578,1756">The cat looks very familiar to you. In fact, it looks like a giant version of your own pet cat [[Molly]].

Especially when she opens her big clear blue eyes, looks at you and [[wiggles]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="31" name="Molly" tags="" position="704,1756">Molly meows. 

This is okay. Molly is your cat.

Molly [[loves you|wiggles]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="32" name="wiggles" tags="" position="702,1631">Molly wiggles. The mountain shakes.

You turn to head out of the cave. If you roof falls, you don&#39;t want to trapped.

Behind you, Molly [[chirrups]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="33" name="chirrups" tags="" position="705,1506">You sprint towards the front of the cave. Molly lands with a crash behind you as you take off down the mountain.

Groggily, you [[open your eyes|base of the mountain]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="35" name="falling" tags="" position="1081,877">You fall. (if: $toy is true)[The feathered cat toy from Anna streams in the wind, the feathers bright and fascinating.]

You fall into mist.

(if: $fallen is false)[Through the mist, you hear small mewling peeps. It sounds like kittens miaowing. You remember when your cat Molly had kittens, little plugs of fur that turned startling quickly into tiny cats. You remember her teaching them to hunt, hers and their wiggles just before they would pounce. You wonder if Molly remembers the loss.

What a strange thing to think of as you fall.]

(else:)[As you fall, once again you hear the small squeaking peeps of kittens. You remember hearing that adult cats don&#39;t miaow to each other, only to humans.]

You fall.

You think: when you dream, when you fall, shouldn&#39;t you wake up when you hit the ground?

You fall.

[[You...|base of the mountain]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="36" name="knock on doors" tags="" position="31,1129">You try knocking on a cardboard door. It&#39;s difficult to knock on damp cardboard, but you do succeed in making a muffled sound.

<tw-passagedata pid="37" name="Anna!" tags="" position="24,1426">(set: $anna to true)

&quot;Hello stranger.&quot;

It&#39;s strange to hear Anna&#39;s voice come from the mouse&#39;s head, but it&#39;s definitely her.

[[What are you doing here?]] </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="38" name="What are you doing here?" tags="" position="24,1576">&quot;Fag break instead finishing some piece of shite essay&quot; she says. Anna studied philosophy, and you feel like that was a long time ago but apparently she is still writing essays.

[[Do you ever write any other sort?]]
[[I think I&#39;ll be going]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="39" name="Do you ever write any other sort?" tags="" position="24,1726">&quot;Twat&quot; says Anna, but she&#39;s smiling.

<tw-passagedata pid="41" name="Sit down opposite Anna" tags="" position="24,1876">“What criterion does Descartes offer as a way of distinguishing waking from dreaming experiences? Does it work?”

Anna laughs.

&quot;You know, all that, &#39;Last night I dreamt I was a butterfly, and then when I woke up, I wondered if I was a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or something, something, something…&#39;&quot;

You laugh, too, thinking that you&#39;ve missed this conversation. Not others that you had, though. But you realise that you remember this specific conversation.

[[Where are we?]]
[[What happened to your head?]]
[[Goodbye, Anna|streets]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="42" name="Where are we?" tags="" position="24,2026">&quot;Last night I dreamt I was a butterfly...&quot; Anna says again, looking vague. 

&quot;That’s Zhuangzi, you know. I wonder why a butterfly and not, say, a cat.&quot;

[[What happened to your head?]]
[[This is creepy, I&#39;m leaving.|streets]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="43" name="What happened to your head?" tags="" position="174,2026">Anna doesn&#39;t reply, but finishes her cigarette. She starts straight away to roll another one, dropping bits of tobacco as she does. She has her regular hands, quick and clumsy as ever.

You remember how much it used to annoy you when she dropped tobacco everywhere, how you were always picking it out the carpet. You feel a little petty when you think about how big a deal you used to make it out if it.

[[Where are we?]]
[[How is your mother?]]
[[Goodbye, Anna|streets]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="44" name="How is your mother?" tags="" position="310,2029">&quot;The same. Mad as a box of lobsters.&quot;

[[Frogs. Box of frogs.]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="45" name="Frogs. Box of frogs." tags="" position="448,2036">&quot;In her case, lobsters... She’s doing this weird research thing. With lobsters. Mapping their neurons. Making computer models of their neurons.&quot;

Anna has finished rolling her cigarette, and lights it.

[[I wish you would stop smoking.]]
[[Tell me more about the lobsters.]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="46" name="I wish you would stop smoking." tags="" position="448,2186">It is true, you always wished she&#39;d stop. You think it&#39;s a disgusting habit, and you told her that many times. It was a recurring theme in your arguments.

There were a lot of recurring argument themes, by the end.

[[I missed you, you know]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="47" name="Tell me more about the lobsters." tags="" position="598,2186">&quot;I wonder, if you make a computer program of a real lobster, and then you, I don’t know, do something that causes it pain…&quot;

&quot;Plunge it alive into boiling water?&quot; you suggest. You don&#39;t think before you say it. You just remember how this conversation went.

&quot;So if you write a program that plunges your lobster program into programmed boiling water… Is that cruel? It’s just a dream of a lobster. But does it know that?&quot; 

Mouse-Anna looks thoughtful.

[[I missed you, you know]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="48" name="I missed you, you know" tags="" position="598,2336">&quot;Did I ever tell you I had this dream about us?&quot;

Anna says nothing. 

You remember the dream. After you and Anna broke up, you dreamt that we went for a walk, and you had a conversation.

You asked Anna if it was really over, and she said that it was, but that she was sorry. And then - then you had a moment when I realized you was dreaming, and you said to Anna “This is a dream, isn’t it?”

Mouse-Anna in front of you asks, &quot;What did I say to that?&quot;

You say to Anna: &quot;You told me that I was still really talking to you, and you really talking to me. We just happened to be doing it in a dream&quot;.

[[It was a strange dream]]
</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="49" name="It was a strange dream" tags="" position="598,2486">Anna pauses in her smoking, and regards you with her giant dark mouse eyes. You struggle to remember what her face should have looked like, but this dark stare you remember well. Her stare used to make you feel special in the beginning, and then uncomfortable later on.

She holds out the cigarette to you.

[[Take the cigarette]]
[[Ignore the cigarette]]
 
 </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="50" name="Take the cigarette" tags="" position="598,2636">(set: $toy to true)

You take the cigarette from Anna, but as you take it, you realise that it is not fact a cigarette, but a long wooden stick. 

Even though you watched her roll it, it has definitely now became a wooden stick with string tied to the end of it. At the end of the string is a knotted bunch of feathers.

You bounce the stick, watching the feathers bounce up and down.

When you look up, Anna has gone, and you are alone in the room. At least this time, [[it wasn&#39;t you who left|streets]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="51" name="Ignore the cigarette" tags="" position="748,2636">You ignore the cigarette, and Anna sits in silence smoking. 

This too feels familiar - the pair of you sitting in silence, whilst she smokes and you sit there feeling first guilty and then angry for feeling guilty. No-one could maintain a silence like Anna.

It feels like you have been sitting there for years.

Eventually, as always, you stand up and leave her sitting there, her huge eyes following you as you walk out of the room and back onto the [[streets]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="52" name="Told me what?" tags="" position="169,607">&quot;I told you not to go to cat mountain&quot; replies the frog. He sighs, and does not say any more.

You sprint down the path. You hear Molly yowl, and look back over your shoulder. She is chasing you, gaining on you.

You reach the village crossraods - do you [[head to the market]], the [[streets of houses]], or out towards the [[rocky cliff|edge of the village]]?</tw-passagedata>

Of course, you are at home, in bed. Where else would you be?

You sit up. You try to massage some life back into your cramped arm. 

On your pillow, above the indentation made by your head, Molly appears to have also just woken up. She looks at you, yawns, stretches. She must have been sleeping around your head. When she woke up, she must woken you. 

&quot;Mmmrrraaaa&quot; says Molly. She yawns again, her tongue bright pink and her teeth so wickedly sharp. You shudder. 

&quot;Mmmnnneeeee&quot; says Molly, requesting breakfast, even though it is the middle of the night. When you continue to stare at her, she jumps off the bed, and pads off into the night.

THE END</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="58" name="over the edge" tags="" position="799,1007">Molly catches sight of the feathers - her favourite!

Swerving at the last minute, the giant cat leaps towards the tiny feathers. She hooks her paws over it, over you, tumbling both you and her over the edge of the cliff.

You fall.

You and Molly fall.
