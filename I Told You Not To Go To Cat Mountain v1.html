</script><tw-passagedata pid="1" name="base of the mountain" tags="" position="825,249">You wake up cold and damp. The surface underneath you is hard and uncomfortable, and your right arm is numb from being trapped under your body. Where are you? The last thing you remember you were getting into bed at hom.

You sit up, and realise that you are outside, now sitting up on rocky ground. You try to massage some life back into your cramped arm. The damp is from the air, as a thick mist lies across all you can see.

Through the mist, you can make out the jagged shape of a [[mountain]] rising up ahead of you.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="2" name="mountain" tags="" position="432,249">The mountain rises above you. The fog makes it hard to be sure but it look like a sharp and jagged tooth. A [[path]] leads up the mountain, rocky and steep. You can barely see in front of you. A few paces, at the most. The path disappears into the [[mist]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="path" tags="" position="454,504">It&#39;s a path leading up the mountain, lined by a few [[trees]]. The fog seems a little thinner as it rises up, although your visibility is still measured in paces.

You take a moment to [[smell the air]].

The path is thin and rocky, but you think you should be able to [[climb up the path]] - even though, as you gloomily realise, you are in your bare feet. You try not to panic as you think how you got from your bed to your current location in your pyjamas and bare feet.

It&#39;s either that or hang around here at the bottom of the [[mountain]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="mist" tags="" position="327,377">The mist is cold. You can feel the damp soaking into your clothes. Looking down, you see that you are wearing only your pyjamas. You don&#39;t know how you ended up here in just your sleepwear.

You can&#39;t see anybody else around, either on the [[path]] or in the direction leading [[away from the mountain]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="5" name="away from the mountain" tags="" position="199,376">You turn your back on the incisor-shaped mountain. You trudge away from it across bare flat ground. 

The visibility was bad before. It seems even worse now. 

If you hold your arm out in front of you, you can barely see the end of your fingers as you head [[further from the mountain]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="6" name="further from the mountain" tags="" position="306,249">As you walk away from the mountain, you hear [[strange sounds in the mist]].

You are making a determind effort to walk in a straight line, but you can&#39;t shake the feeling that you are not walking in the direction you intend. You could swear the landscape is [[rearranging beneath your feet]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="7" name="climb up the path" tags="" position="453,630">As you climb up the path, the air is definitely clearing. In fact, you can see shapes ahead on you. Are those houses? 

You start to hurry. Thank goodness, there are houses there will be people there, you&#39;ll explain the them what happened, maybe they will be able to tell you where you are, they can call someone...

You draw closer to the first building. It looks odd - it&#39;s square shaped, with brown sagging walls. Is that a painted on window...? You start to feel confused as you [[enter the village]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="8" name="trees" tags="" position="326,504">A few stunted trees grow in the rocky mountain soil at the side of the [[path]]. Looking closely, the trees seem to have been... scraped? Scratched? There are long raking marks down them, and some have bent and broken where they look like they have been chewed in the middle. What would chew a tree like that?</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="9" name="smell the air" tags="" position="606,503">The air on the [[path]] is still wet with moisture, but you catch a smell of something else as well. Bitter and sharp, it&#39;s familiar but you can&#39;t quite place it. It seems to get stronger and more distinct the higher you get.

 </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="10" name="strange sounds in the mist" tags="" position="177,250">Through the mist, you can hear intermittent noises. It sounds faint, and faraway, but it remind you of.. squealing? No - it&#39;s like mewling, like a small animal. The piteous cries seem to call you [[further from the mountain]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="11" name="enter the village" tags="" position="453,755">You look closely at the first house that you come to. It is made out of cardboard. 

In fact, it is a cardboard box. 

A cardboad box, with windows drawn on and flaps cut in for doors.

This is the strangest [[village]] you have ever seen.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="12" name="village" tags="" position="453,880">You walk further into the village to look for someone to talk to. The streets are quiet. You notice that all the houses are cardboard boxes. 

You find yourself at a crossroads. You hope one of the paths will lead you to someone to talk to.

The path ahead of you looks like it leads to stalls set out in a [[market]].

The path to your left leads into a smaller warren of [[streets]].

The path to your right looks like it leads to a rocky cliff marking the [[edge of the village]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="13" name="market" tags="" position="326,1005">In a square of cardboard-box houses is a ring of [[market stalls]]. A few stallholders mill behind the stalls. Finally - people. 

There is also a path that leads on up [[through the village]], further up the mountain.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="14" name="streets" tags="" position="453,1005">Here you will find [[one house]] that will answer your knock.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="15" name="edge of the village" tags="" position="578,881">Following the path out of the village, you reach a fork. One way leads [[straight on]], the other to a [[small hut]]. Or you can head back [[village]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="16" name="an old friend" tags="" position="325,880">After talking to your friend, if you ask correctly, you acquire the feathered cat toy. 

Then you head back to the [[village]] .</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="17" name="one house" tags="" position="453,1131">In here you find [[someone you used to know well]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="18" name="straight on" tags="" position="705,880">This will you to the [[edge of the cliff]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="19" name="small hut" tags="" position="703,1006">You head down the path that leads to a small wooden hut, which sits on small plateau reached via a path around the mountain side.

The wind picks up on the narrow rocky path. To one wide the mountain rises steeply, to the other it slopes downwards at an alarming angle. Both above and below are obscured by that same mist. There is a sharp tang in the air, like pine but earthier.

As you reach the end of the path, you see that in fact the hut is a wooden garden [[shed]]. In front of the shed, an [[old man]] sits with his back to you.

The path behind leads back to the [[edge of the village]] .</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="20" name="market stalls" tags="" position="199,1001">There are a few different stalls in the market, although you are the only customer.

You go to speak to the nearest stall holder. 

&quot;[[Excuse me...|stallholder]]&quot;
&quot;[[I don&#39;t know where I am...|stallholder]]&quot;
&quot;[[Can you help me?|stallholder]]&quot;

Here you can looks through [[piles of old junk]], or visit a stall run by [[an old friend]] .</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="21" name="through the village" tags="" position="325,1132">Heading through the village leads to a path leading [[further up the mountain]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="22" name="piles of old junk" tags="" position="200,876">There&#39;s not much here, and eventually you come back to the [[market stalls]] .</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="23" name="edge of the cliff" tags="" position="830,879">Here you can [[look over the edge]], or stand and feel the [[wind in your hair]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="24" name="look over the edge" tags="" position="956,878">You can head back to the [[edge of the cliff]] or even [[jump over the edge]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="25" name="wind in your hair" tags="" position="830,1005">Feel the wind in your hair at the [[edge of the cliff]] .</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="26" name="jump over the edge" tags="" position="828,752">But jumping over the edge will just take you back to the [[base of the mountain]] .</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="27" name="someone you used to know well" tags="" position="578,1131">After talking to [[Anna]], if you ask correctly, you acquire the duck strips. 

Then you head back to the [[streets]] .</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="28" name="further up the mountain" tags="" position="325,1257">a steep rocky path leads up the mountain. Do you [[follow it up]] or, head back down to the [[village|through the village]] ?</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="29" name="Anna" tags="" position="578,1281">You: I missed you, you know.

Anna: You could have called.

You: I know. Did I ever tell you I had this dream about us?

Anna: I don‘t think I want to hear this, Ben.

You: No… After we broke up, I dreamt that we went for a walk, and we had a conversation.

Anna: What did we say?

You: I asked you if it was really over, and you said that it was, but that you were sorry. And then - then I had this moment where I realized I was dreaming, and I said to you “This is a dream, isn’t it?”

Anna: What did I say?

You: You said “Yes, but I’m really talking to you, and you’re really talking to me. We just happen to be doing it in a dream”. For ages afterwards, I wanted to ask you if you’d had that same dream, and if we had really had that conversation.

Anna: Mmm.

You: So? Did that conversation really happen? Or was it just something that I dreamt?

Anna: But you were the one who left me. 

You: I don’t remember.

The [[mountain]] where you were just a moment ago? But how can that be? You must have somehow got turned around in that fog - but you were SURE you were heading away from the mountain...</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="33" name="follow it up" tags="" position="324,1382">As you climb up the mountain the air gets thinner. Breath becomes shallower. The mist clears and you see that you are winding up around the side of the mountain. Steep cliffs fall away to your left, and sheer rock rise up to your right. You spiral [[upwards]].

</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="34" name="upwards" tags="" position="449,1381">At last the path levels out. You are at the top of the mountain. Looking down, you cannot see anything below you but the clouds. Along the path is a [[cave]].

There is a sharp, bitter [[scent]].
</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="35" name="cave" tags="" position="449,1506">
The cave is very dark, and smells of meat. A low rumbling comes from [[inside the cave]].

</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="36" name="scent" tags="" position="580,1503">Outside the [[cave|upwards]]  rocks have been scrabbled over to hide animal scat with a sharp, bitter scent.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="37" name="inside the cave" tags="" position="449,1631">Inside the cave sleeps a giant white cat with black tips to her ears. She is enormous - the size of an office building, of a hillside. She is tight and snug within the cave.

The cat seems [[familiar]].

She sees you, and wiggles. The whole mountain when she [[wiggles]].</tw-passagedata>

Especially when she opens her big clear blue eyes, looks at you and [[wiggles]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="40" name="Molly" tags="" position="704,1756">Molly meows. 

This is okay. Molly is your cat.

Molly [[loves you]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="41" name="loves you" tags="" position="830,1756">Molly wiggles. The mountain shakes.

You turn to head out of the cave. If you roof falls, you don&#39;t want to trapped.

Behind you, Molly [[chirrups]].</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="46" name="old man" tags="" position="958.0001,1116">The old man turns to look at you as you approach. In fact, he may not be old after all - it&#39;s hard to tell, as where his head should be there is in fact the head of a frog. 

He reminds you of Mister Toad, in the Wind In The Willows, in the television series you watched as a child. This frog, however, has the body of a man, and he doesn&#39;t seem like the dandyish fop from the children&#39;s programme. 

You notice that the frog is wearing one of your Dad&#39;s old jumpers, and it is drinking tea from your Dad&#39;s favourite mug. The hand that isn&#39;t holding the mug is stroking something on its knee.

&quot;[[Hello, Dad]].&quot;
[[Enter the shed|shed]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="47" name="Hello, Dad" tags="" position="807,1292">Your Frog-Dad nods to you in a genial fashion, but says nothing. He looks out across the view, which consists of a few feet of rock, and mist.

He continues stroking his [[knee]], and drinking his [[coffee]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="48" name="knee" tags="" position="807,1442">On your father&#39;s knee sits a small black and white kitten. It has black a mostly black face, with a white chin and underbelly. It has three white socks, and its eyes are blue.

It looks at you, and meows.

[[Stroke the kitten]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="49" name="coffee" tags="" position="957,1442">The mug has a faded picture of Pudsey Bear on it. You remember that it was a special edition for Children In Need, when you were a child. 

You remember when the mug broke, when you were a teenager, and you wrapped the pieces in newspaper and hid them in the bin because you were ashamed of having broken it. Your dad hated when you were careless with things. He&#39;d never shout, but would simply look disappointed and disappear to his [[shed]].</tw-passagedata>
