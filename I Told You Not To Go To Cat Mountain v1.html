</script><tw-passagedata pid="1" name="base of the mountain" tags="" position="557,246">You wake up, cold and damp. The surface underneath you is hard and uncomfortable, and your right arm is numb from being trapped under your body. Where are you? The last thing you remember you were getting into bed at home…

You sit up, and realise that you are outside, now sitting up on rocky ground. You try to massage some life back into your cramped arm. The damp is from the air - a thick mist lies across all you can see.

However, even through the mist, you can make out the shape of a [[mountain]] rising up ahead of you, its jagged peak hazy and shrouded in the gloom and fog.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="2" name="mountain" tags="" position="432,249">The mountain rises above you, sharp and jagged where you can see it through the fog. A [[path]] leads up the mountain, rocky and steep. You can barely see in front of you: a few paces, at the most. The path disappears into the [[mist]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="path" tags="" position="454,504">It&#39;s a path leading up the mountain, lined by a few [[trees]]. The fog seems a little thinner as it rises up, although your visibility is still measured in paces.

You take a moment to [[smell the air]].

The path is thin and rocky, but you think you should be able to [[climb up the path]] - even though, as you gloomily realise, you are in your bare feet. You try not to panic as you think how you got from your bed to your current location in your pyjamas and bare feet.

It&#39;s either that or hang around here at the bottom of the [[mountain]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="mist" tags="" position="327,377">The mist is cold, and very damp. You can feel the moisture soaking into your clothes. Looking down, you see that you are wearing only your pyjamas. How did you end up here in your sleepwear?

You can&#39;t see anybody else around, either on the [[path]] or in the direction leading [[away from the mountain]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="5" name="away from the mountain" tags="" position="199,376">You turn your back on the mountain, and trudge away across bare but flat ground. 

Although the visibility was bad before, it seems even worse now. If you hold your arm out in front of you, you can barely see the end of your fingers as you head [[further from the mountain]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="6" name="further from the mountain" tags="" position="306,249">You turn your back on the mountain, and trudge away across bare but flat ground. As you walk, you hear [[strange sounds in the mist]].

You are making a determind effort to talk in a straight, but you can&#39;t shake the feeling that you are not walking in the direction you instead, as though the landscape is [[rearranging beneath your feet]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="7" name="climb up the path" tags="" position="453,630">As you climb up the path, the air is definitely clearing. In fact, you can see shapes ahead on you. Are those houses? 

You start to hurry. Thank goodness, there are houses there will be people there, you&#39;ll explain the them what happened, maybe they will be able to tell you where you are, they can call someone...

You draw closer to the first building. It looks odd - it&#39;s square shaped, with brown sagging walls. Is that a painted on window...? You start to feel confused as you [[enter the village]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="8" name="trees" tags="" position="326,504">A few stunted trees grow in the rocky mountain soil at the side of the [[path]]. Looking closely, the trees seem to have been... scraped? Scratched? There are long raking marks down them, and some have bent and broken where they look like they have been chewed in the middle. What would chew a tree like that?</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="9" name="smell the air" tags="" position="606,503">The air on the [[path]] is still wet with moisture, but you catch a smell of something else as well. Bitter and sharp, it&#39;s familiar but you can&#39;t quite place it. It seems to get stronger and more distinct the higher you get.

 </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="10" name="strange sounds in the mist" tags="" position="177,250">Through the mist, you can hear intermittent noises. It sounds faint, and faraway, but it remind you of.. squealing? No - it&#39;s like mewling, like a small animal. The piteous cries seem to call you [[further from the mountain]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="11" name="enter the village" tags="" position="453,755">You look closely at the first house that you come to. It is made out of cardboard. 

In fact, it is a cardboard box. 

A cardboad box, with windows drawn on and flaps cut in for doors.

This is the strangest [[village]] you have ever seen.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="12" name="village" tags="" position="453,880">You walk further into the village to look for someone to talk to. All the houses are cardboard boxes.

<tw-passagedata pid="15" name="edge of the village" tags="" position="578,881">Following the path out of the village, you reach a fork. One way leads [[straight on]], the other to a [[small hut]]. Or you can head back [[village]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="16" name="an old friend" tags="" position="325,880">After talking to your friend, if you ask correctly, you acquire the feathered cat toy.

<tw-passagedata pid="30" name="Anna" tags="" position="578,1281">You: I missed you, you know.

Anna: You could have called.

You: I know. Did I ever tell you I had this dream about us?

Anna: I don‘t think I want to hear this, Ben.

You: No… After we broke up, I dreamt that we went for a walk, and we had a conversation.

Anna: What did we say?

You: I asked you if it was really over, and you said that it was, but that you were sorry. And then - then I had this moment where I realized I was dreaming, and I said to you “This is a dream, isn’t it?”

Anna: What did I say?

You: You said “Yes, but I’m really talking to you, and you’re really talking to me. We just happen to be doing it in a dream”. For ages afterwards, I wanted to ask you if you’d had that same dream, and if we had really had that conversation.

Anna: Mmm.

You: So? Did that conversation really happen? Or was it just something that I dreamt?

Anna: But you were the one who left me. 

You: I don’t remember.</tw-passagedata>

The [[mountain]] where you were just a moment ago? But how can that be? You must have somehow got turned around in that fog - but you were SURE you were heading away from the mountain...</tw-passagedata>
