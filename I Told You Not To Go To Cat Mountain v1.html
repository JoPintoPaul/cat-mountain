</script><tw-passagedata pid="1" name="base of the mountain" tags="" position="557,246">You wake up, cold and damp. The surface underneath you is hard and uncomfortable, and your right arm is numb from being trapped under your body. Where are you? The last thing you remember you were getting into bed at hom.

You sit up, and realise that you are outside, now sitting up on rocky ground. You try to massage some life back into your cramped arm. The damp is from the air, as a thick mist lies across all you can see.

Through the mist, you can make out the jagged shape of a [[mountain]] rising up ahead of you.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="2" name="mountain" tags="" position="432,249">The mountain rises above you. The fog makes it hard to be sure but it look like a sharp and jagged tooth. A [[path]] leads up the mountain, rocky and steep. You can barely see in front of you. A few paces, at the most. The path disappears into the [[mist]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="path" tags="" position="454,504">It&#39;s a path leading up the mountain, lined by a few [[trees]]. The fog seems a little thinner as it rises up, although your visibility is still measured in paces.

You take a moment to [[smell the air]].

The path is thin and rocky, but you think you should be able to [[climb up the path]] - even though, as you gloomily realise, you are in your bare feet. You try not to panic as you think how you got from your bed to your current location in your pyjamas and bare feet.

It&#39;s either that or hang around here at the bottom of the [[mountain]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="mist" tags="" position="327,377">The mist is cold. You can feel the damp soaking into your clothes. Looking down, you see that you are wearing only your pyjamas. You don&#39;t know how you ended up here in just your sleepwear.

You can&#39;t see anybody else around, either on the [[path]] or in the direction leading [[away from the mountain]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="5" name="away from the mountain" tags="" position="199,376">You turn your back on the incisor-shaped mountain. You trudge away from it across bare flat ground. 

The visibility was bad before. It seems even worse now. 

If you hold your arm out in front of you, you can barely see the end of your fingers as you head [[further from the mountain]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="6" name="further from the mountain" tags="" position="306,249">As you walk away from the mountain, you hear [[strange sounds in the mist]].

You are making a determind effort to walk in a straight line, but you can&#39;t shake the feeling that you are not walking in the direction you intend. You could swear the landscape is [[rearranging beneath your feet]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="7" name="climb up the path" tags="" position="453,630">As you climb up the path, the air is definitely clearing. In fact, you can see shapes ahead on you. Are those houses? 

You start to hurry. Thank goodness, there are houses there will be people there, you&#39;ll explain the them what happened, maybe they will be able to tell you where you are, they can call someone...

You draw closer to the first building. It looks odd - it&#39;s square shaped, with brown sagging walls. Is that a painted on window...? You start to feel confused as you [[enter the village]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="8" name="trees" tags="" position="326,504">A few stunted trees grow in the rocky mountain soil at the side of the [[path]]. Looking closely, the trees seem to have been... scraped? Scratched? There are long raking marks down them, and some have bent and broken where they look like they have been chewed in the middle. What would chew a tree like that?</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="9" name="smell the air" tags="" position="606,503">The air on the [[path]] is still wet with moisture, but you catch a smell of something else as well. Bitter and sharp, it&#39;s familiar but you can&#39;t quite place it. It seems to get stronger and more distinct the higher you get.

 </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="10" name="strange sounds in the mist" tags="" position="177,250">Through the mist, you can hear intermittent noises. It sounds faint, and faraway, but it remind you of.. squealing? No - it&#39;s like mewling, like a small animal. The piteous cries seem to call you [[further from the mountain]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="11" name="enter the village" tags="" position="453,755">You look closely at the first house that you come to. It is made out of cardboard. 

In fact, it is a cardboard box. 

A cardboad box, with windows drawn on and flaps cut in for doors.

This is the strangest [[village]] you have ever seen.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="12" name="village" tags="" position="453,880">You walk further into the village to look for someone to talk to. The streets are quiet. You notice that all the houses are cardboard boxes. 

You find yourself at a crossroads. You hope one of the paths will lead you to someone to talk to.

The path ahead of you looks like it leads to stalls set out in a [[market]].

The path to your left leads into a smaller warren of [[streets]].

The path to your right looks like it leads to a rocky cliff marking the [[edge of the village]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="13" name="market" tags="" position="326,1005">In a square of cardboard-box houses is a ring of [[market stalls]]. A few stallholders mill behind the stalls. Finally - people. 

There is also a path that leads on up [[through the village]], further up the mountain.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="14" name="streets" tags="" position="453,1005">On the street, the cardboard houses are visibly sagging as the moisture from the mist makes them damp. 

You try to peer in a window, but realise that the windows are simply frames drawn onto the cardboard, like a child&#39;s drawing. No people are visible on the street.

You debate whether to [[knock on doors]], or return to the [[village]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="15" name="edge of the village" tags="" position="578,881">Following the path out of the village, you reach a fork. One way leads [[straight on]], the other to a [[small hut]]. Or you can head back [[village]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="16" name="an old friend" tags="" position="325,880">After talking to your friend, if you ask correctly, you acquire the feathered cat toy. 

Then you head back to the [[village]] .</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="17" name="one house" tags="" position="453,1131">&quot;Who is it?&quot; calls a voice that you recognise.

&quot;It&#39;s me&quot; you answer. For the moment, your name has escaped you. This is less frightening than it would be normally. 

The door opens, partially. It&#39;s just a flap in the cardboard, with a doorknob drawn on it, but it opens wide enough to admit you inside.

Inside, you find yourself in a normal-looking room that you know well. You used to come here often to visit Anna. This was the kitchen in Anna&#39;s first flat, the one with the bathroom off the kitchen and the overgrown sunken garden, and carpet that doesn&#39;t reach to the walls. Anna hasn&#39;t lived here for years.

From this side, the door looks like a normal door. You look outside again, and see the rocky mountain side and cardboard houses are still there. 

[[Anna|someone you used to know well]] is sitting at the kitchen table, drinking spiced tea and smoking a rolled-up cigarette, just like Anna always did. 

For some reason, Anna has the head of a mouse. This is odd, because Anna definitely used to have a human head when you were together.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="18" name="straight on" tags="" position="705,880">This will you to the [[edge of the cliff]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="19" name="small hut" tags="" position="703,1006">Here you&#39;ll meet an old man - your [[father]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="20" name="market stalls" tags="" position="129,1003">There are a few different stalls in the market, although you are the only customer.

You go to speak to the nearest stall holder. 

&quot;[[Excuse me...|stallholder]]&quot;
&quot;[[I don&#39;t know where I am...|stallholder]]&quot;
&quot;[[Can you help me?|stallholder]]&quot;

Here you can looks through [[piles of old junk]], or visit a stall run by [[an old friend]] .</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="21" name="through the village" tags="" position="133,1149">Heading through the village leads to a path leading [[further up the mountain]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="22" name="piles of old junk" tags="" position="131,875">There&#39;s not much here, and eventually you come back to the [[market stalls]] .</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="23" name="edge of the cliff" tags="" position="830,879">Here you can [[look over the edge]], or stand and feel the [[wind in your hair]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="24" name="father" tags="" position="578,1006">After [[talking to your father]], if you ask correctly, you acquire the kitten. 

Then you head back to the [[edge of the village]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="25" name="look over the edge" tags="" position="956,878">You can head back to the [[edge of the cliff]] or even [[jump over the edge]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="26" name="wind in your hair" tags="" position="830,1005">Feel the wind in your hair at the [[edge of the cliff]] .</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="27" name="jump over the edge" tags="" position="957,753">But jumping over the edge will just take you back to the [[base of the mountain]] .</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="28" name="someone you used to know well" tags="" position="578,1131">After talking to [[Anna]], if you ask [[correctly]], you acquire the duck strips. 

Then you head back to the [[streets]] .</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="30" name="Anna" tags="" position="578,1281">You: I missed you, you know.

Anna: You could have called.

You: I know. Did I ever tell you I had this dream about us?

Anna: I don‘t think I want to hear this, Ben.

You: No… After we broke up, I dreamt that we went for a walk, and we had a conversation.

Anna: What did we say?

You: I asked you if it was really over, and you said that it was, but that you were sorry. And then - then I had this moment where I realized I was dreaming, and I said to you “This is a dream, isn’t it?”

Anna: What did I say?

You: You said “Yes, but I’m really talking to you, and you’re really talking to me. We just happen to be doing it in a dream”. For ages afterwards, I wanted to ask you if you’d had that same dream, and if we had really had that conversation.

Anna: Mmm.

You: So? Did that conversation really happen? Or was it just something that I dreamt?

Anna: But you were the one who left me. 

You: I don’t remember.</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="32" name="rearranging beneath your feet" tags="" position="303,121">You trudge on. The mist begins to clear a little, thankfully, and you hurry forwards towards...

The [[mountain]] where you were just a moment ago? But how can that be? You must have somehow got turned around in that fog - but you were SURE you were heading away from the mountain...</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="34" name="knock on doors" tags="" position="328.0001,1132">You try knocking on a cardboard door. It&#39;s difficult to knock on damp cardboard, but you do succeed in making a muffled sound.

It takes a few attempts, but finally you knock on the door of [[one house]] that answers.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="35" name="correctly" tags="" position="453,1281">[[Anna!]]
[[What are you doing here?]]
</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="36" name="Anna!" tags="" position="453,1431">&quot;Hello stranger.&quot; 

It&#39;s a little strange, hearing Anna&#39;s voice come from the mouse&#39;s head, but it&#39;s definitely her.

[[What are you doing here?]] </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="37" name="What are you doing here?" tags="" position="604,1431">&quot;Fag break instead finishing some piece of shite essay&quot; she says. Anna studied philosophy, and you feel like that was a long time ago but apparently she is still writing essays.

[[Do you ever write any other sort?]]
[[I think I&#39;ll be going]]
</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="38" name="Do you ever write any other sort?" tags="" position="604,1581">&quot;Twat&quot; says Anna, but she&#39;s smiling, a little.

[[Sit down opposite Anna]]
Head back to the [[streets]]

<tw-passagedata pid="41" name="So what’s this essay, then?" tags="" position="48,1508">“What criterion does Descartes offer as a way of distinguishing waking from dreaming experiences? Does it work?”

Anna laughs.

&quot;You know, all that, &#39;Last night I dreamt I was a butterfly, and then when I woke up, I wondered if I was a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or something, something, something…&#39;&quot;

You laugh, too, thinking that you&#39;ve missed this conversation. Not others that you had, though. But you realise that you remember this specific conversation.

[[Where are we?]]
[[What happened to your head?]]
[[How is your mother?]]
[[Goodbye, Anna|streets]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="42" name="Where are we?" tags="" position="44,1696">&quot;&#39;Last night I dreamt I was a butterfly...&quot; Anna says again, looking vague. 

&quot;That’s Zhuangzi, you know. I wonder why a butterfly.&quot;

[[What happened to your head?]]
[[How is your mother?]]
[[This is creepy, I&#39;m leaving.|streets]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="43" name="What happened to your head?" tags="" position="212,1785">Anna doesn&#39;t reply, but finishes her cigarette. She starts straight away to roll another one, dropping bits of tobacco as she does. 

You remember how much it used to annoy you when she dropped tobacco everywhere, how you were always picking it out the carpet. You feel a little petty when you think about how big a deal you used to make it out if it.

[[Where are we?]]
[[How is your mother?]]
[[Goodbye, Anna|streets]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="44" name="How is your mother?" tags="" position="337,1693">&quot;The same. Mad as a box of lobsters.&quot;

Anna has finished rolling her cigarette, and lights it.

[[If you don&#39;t stop smoking, I&#39;ll leave|streets]]
[[Tell me more about the lobsters.]]

&quot;Plunge it alive into boiling water?&quot; you suggest. You don&#39;t think before you say it. You just remember how this conversation went.

&quot;So if you write a program that plunges your lobster program into programmed boiling water… Is that cruel? It’s just a dream of a lobster. But does it know that?&quot; Mouse-Anna looks thoughtful.
